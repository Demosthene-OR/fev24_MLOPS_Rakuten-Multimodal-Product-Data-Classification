## Introduction
This repository contains the code for our project **TRANSLATION SYSTEM FOR CONNECTED GLASSES**, developed during our [Data Scientist training](https://datascientest.com/en/data-scientist-course) at [DataScientest](https://datascientest.com/).

The purpose of this project is to explore and implement exploration techniques.

This project is developed by the following team :
- Keyne Dupont ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/keyne-dupont/))
- Tia Ratsimbason ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tia-ratsimbason-42110887/))
- Olivier Renouard ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/olivier-renouard-b6b8a535/) / [GitHub](https://github.com/Demosthene-OR))

## Notebooks
You can browse and run the **[notebooks](./notebooks)**. 

To run the notebooks, you will need to install the dependencies (in a dedicated environment)  
You will find the file requirements.txt in notebooks folder
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Streamlit App
You can also run the **Streamlit App directly on the Cloud**: 

**[Translation System for Connected Glasses](https://demosthene-or-avr23-cds-translation.hf.space/)**

To run the **app locally** (be careful with the paths of the files in the app):
```shell
conda create --name Avr23-cds-translation python=3.10
conda activate Avr23-cds-translation
cd "repertoire o√π se trouve l'application"
pip install -r requirements.txt
# if your operating system is Windows 11, run the following line:
pip install protobuf==3.20.3 streamlit==1.28.0

streamlit run app.py
```

The app should then be available at [localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501).
